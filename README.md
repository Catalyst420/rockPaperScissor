# Graphic Design 
The actual image was screen shot from a graphic design video I liked. The thought was "What better for rock, paper, scissors than an all seeing hand of the 3rd eye varity." So needless to say that I was inspired when i saw it. I chose the dark green back ground because I feel it went with the image really well. Also the red for the text was the complementary color. So easy choice their. I put text shadow on the letters to make them pop, and it made them easier to read. Needless to say(but I will say it anyways) their is quite a bit of color and I had a moment of clashing colors. The shadow fixed it real well. 

# Gratitude
Here is where a developer would put his thanks, so now i will thank my buddies who put up with me for the days i spent on this. Calling them to look at this and that and their ideas of what they thought. As little or large as the idea may have been it was a help.
